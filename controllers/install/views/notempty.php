<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Already Installed</h2>
	<p>It appears that Escher, or another application, is already installed to this database.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a few choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Restore your Escher database from a backed-up copy.  Doing this may repair a broken installation.</li>
	<li>Delete <code>config.php</code>, run the Escher install wizard again, and choose a different table prefix for your database settings.</li>
	<li>Use a database administration tool such as phpMyAdmin to view the contents of the database, deleting any unnecessary tables.</li>
</ul>
